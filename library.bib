abstract = {Text books, including books for general audiences, invariably mention bubble sort in discussions of elementary sorting algorithms. We trace the history of bubble sort, its popularity, and its endurance in the face of pedagogical assertions that code and algorithmic examples used in early courses should be of high quality and adhere to established best practices. This paper is more an historical analysis than a philosophical treatise for the exclusion of bubble sort from books and courses. However, sentiments for exclusion are supported by Knuth [17], "In short, the bubble sort seems to have nothing to recommend it, except a catchy name and the fact that it leads to some interesting theoretical problems." Although bubble sort may not be a best practice sort, perhaps the weight of history is more than enough to compensate and provide for its longevity.},

abstract = {Meta-design of socio-technical systems is an approach which complies with the need of integrating two different types of structures and processes: technical systems which are engineered to provide anticipatable and reliable interactions between users and systems, and social systems which are contingent in their interactions and a subject of evolution. Meta-design is focused on objectives, techniques and processes to allow users to act as designers. In doing so, it does not provide fixed solutions but frameworks within which all stakeholders can contribute to the development of technical functionality and the evolution of the social side such as organizational change, knowledge construction, and collaborative learning. This paper combines the theoretical framework of meta-design and its underlying principles with the consideration of methodological aspects and practical cases. Five different principles are explored: (1) cultures of participation, (2) empowerment for adaptation and evolution, (3) seeding and evolutionary growth, (4) underdesign of models of socio-technical processes, and (5) structuring of communication. Design collaboratories and knowledge management are used as examples to analyse meta-designed socio-technical systems representing socio-technical solutions as well as frameworks within which socio-technical solutions can be developed. The combination of theoretical and methodological consideration leads to a set of practical guidelines for meta-designers.},

Hardware designers have come up with ever more sophisticated memory handling and acceleration techniquessuch as CPU cachesbut these cannot work optimally without some help from the programmer. Unfortunately, neither the structure nor the cost of using the memory subsystem of a computer or the caches on CPUs is well understood by most programmers. This paper explains the structure of memory subsys- tems in use on modern commodity hardware, illustrating why CPU caches were developed, how they work, and what programs should do to achieve optimal performance by utilizing them.},

abstract = {There is much talk today about a business process management (BPM) rEvolution. The revolutionary part is about a new category of software known as the business process management system (BPMS). The evolutionary part is about using the BPMS to exploit existing business and technology assets in a way that creates new value. Along with any revolution comes confusion. What exactly is BPM? Isn't it just workflow technology, which has been in use for twenty years, plus Web services? Why don't we describe what is going on today as the " new workflow rEvolution, " a subtle extension of workflow systems? To answer these questions, we explore the foundations of the workflow paradigm, and describe the paradigm shift in technology that is needed to overcome limitations of workflow systems to build and deploy robust business process management systems—the kind of information systems that businesses now demand as new sources of competitive advantage in an ever more uncertain and complex global economy.},

@article{Malone1994,
abstract = {This survey characterizes an emerging research area, sometimes called coordination theory, that focuses on the interdisciplinary study of coordination. Research in this area uses and extends ideas about coordination from disciplines such as computer science, organization theory, operations research, economics, linguistics, and psychology. A key insight of the framework presented here is that coordination can be seen as the process of managing dependencies among activities. Further progress, therefore, should be possible by characterizing different kinds of dependencies and identifying the coordination processes that can be used to manage them. A variety of processes are analyzed from this perspective, and commonalities across disciplines are identified. Processes analyzed include those for managing shared resources, producer/consumer relationships, simultaneity constraints, and tank/subtask dependencies. Section 3 summarizes ways of applying a coordination perspective in three different domains: (1) understanding the effects of information technology on human organizations and markets, (2) designing cooperative work tools, and (3) designing distributed and parallel computer systems. In the final section, elements of a research agenda in this new area are briefly outlined.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the use of Petri nets for modeling coordinated cyber-physical attacks on the smart grid. Petri nets offer more flexibility and expressiveness than traditional attack trees to represent the actions of simultaneous attackers. However, Petri net models for attacks on very large critical infrastructures such as the smart grid require a great amount of manual effort and detailed expertise in cyber-physical threats. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a novel hierarchical method to construct large Petri nets from a number of smaller Petri nets that can be created separately by different domain experts. The construction method is facilitated by a model description language that enables identical places in different Petri nets to be matched. The new modeling approach is described for an example attack on smart meters, and its efficacy is demonstrated by a proof-of-concept Python program.},

abstract = {Fourier transform infrared microscopy is a powerful tool for the characterization of mineral and protein in histologic sections of bone. This study was concerned with determining whether techniques used to preserve these tissues and to prepare them for sectioning had an effect on spectral properties. The nu 1, nu 3 phosphate bands in the 900-1200 cm-1 spectral region were used to evaluate the structure of the apatitic mineral in fresh-frozen, ethanol-fixed, and formalin-fixed 35-day-old rat femurs; fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed 20-day-old fetal rat femurs; ground 35-day-old rat diaphyseal bone samples; and formalin-fixed, methacrylate-embedded ground diaphyseal bone. The crystallinity (crystal size and perfection) of the bone apatite was assessed by a curve-fitting analysis of the nu 1, nu 3 phosphate bands. Results indicate that ethanol or formalin fixation of the 35-day-old intact rat femur, and formalin fixation and embedding of the ground rat bone do not significantly alter the crystallinity of the apatite. However, formalin fixation of the fetal rat bone did alter the structure of the apatite mineral phase. In addition, evaluation of protein secondary structure in the 35-day-old rat femur from the Amide I and Amide II vibrations near 1650 and 1550 cm-1, respectively, revealed that protein conformation was altered by ethanol fixation.},

abstract = {I thank the ACM for this award. I can't help but feel that I am receiving this honor for timing and serendip- ity as much as technical merit. UNIX1 swept into popu- larity with an industry-wide change from central main- frames to autonomous minis. I suspect that Daniel Bob- row [1] would be here instead of me if he could not afford a PDP-10 and had had to "settle" for a PDP-11. Moreover, the current state of UNIX is the result of the labors of a large number of people. There is an old adage, "Dance with the one that brought you," which means that I should talk about UNIX. I have not worked on mainstream UNIX in many years, yet I continue to get undeserved credit for the work of others. Therefore, I am not going to talk about UNIX, but I want to thank everyone who has contrib- uted. That brings me to Dennis Ritchie. Our collaboration has been a thing of beauty. In the ten years that we have worked together, I can recall only one case of miscoordination of work. On that occasion, I discovered that we both had written the same 20-line assembly language program. I compared the sources and was as- tounded to find that they matched character-for-char- acter. The result of our work together has been far greater than the work that we each contributed. I am a programmer. On my 1040 form, that is what I put down as my occupation. As a programmer, I write programs. I would like to present to you the cutest program I ever wrote. I will do this in three stages and try to bring it together at the end.},

@article{Cheeseman1991,
abstract = {It is well known that for many NP-complete problems, such as K-Sat, etc., typical cases are easy to solve; so that computationally hard cases must be rare (assuming P 6= NP ). This paper shows that NP-complete problems can be summarized by at least one "order parameter ", and that the hard problems occur at a critical value of such a parameter. This critical value separates two regions of characteristically different properties. For example, for K-colorability, the critical value separates overconstrained from underconstrained random graphs, and it marks the value at which the probability of a solution changes abruptly from near 0 to near 1. It is the high density of wellseparated almost solutions (local minima) at this boundary that cause search algorithms to "thrash". This boundary is a type of phase transition and we show that it is preserved under mappings between problems. We show that for some P problems either there is no phase transition or it occurs for bounded N (and so bounds the cost). These results suggest a way of deciding if a problem is in P or NP and why they are different.},

abstract = {Currently, CyberPhysical Systems (CPS) represents a great challenge for automatic control and smart systems engineering on both theoretical and practical levels. Designing CPS requires approaches involving multi-disciplinary competences. However they are designed to be autonomous, the CPS presents a part of uncertainty, which requires inter-action with human for engineering, monitoring, controlling, performing operational maintenance, etc. This human-CPS interaction led naturally to the human in-the-loop (HITL) concept. Nevertheless, this HITL concept, which stems from a reductionist point of view, exhibits limitations due to the different natures of the systems involved. As opposed to this classical approach, we propose, in this paper, a model of Bio-CPS (i.e. systems based on an integration of computational elements within biological systems) grounded on theoretical biology, physics and computer sciences and based on the key concept of human systems integration.},
